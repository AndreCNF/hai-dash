model_type:
  RNN:
    Traditional Recurrent Neural Network type model, which uses a simple recurrent connection with few parameters and a single hidden memory.
  LSTM:
    Advanced RNN model, named Long Short-Term Memory, which adds another hidden connection and a more sophisticated memory management, that may allow for longer memory and a more stable training process.
  MF1-LSTM:
    LSTM-based recurrent model that accounts for time variation by scaling the forget gate's output according to the difference between consecutive samples' timestamps.
bidir:
  is bidirectional:
    Analyses previous instances of each time series in both directions, from back to the front and backwards.
  single direction:
    Only sees samples in the direction from the past to the present.
embedding:
  one hot encoded:
    Categorical variables get a single, binary feature to each category.
  pre-embedded:
    Includes a pre-trained embedding layer, i.e. a mapping function that converts categories into a continuous vector.
  with embedding:
    Includes an embedding layer, i.e. a mapping function that converts categories into a continuous vector, which was trained simultaneously with the rest of the model.
delta_ts:
  uses delta_ts:
    Has time variation between samples in consideration, using that information as an additional feature.
  no delta_ts:
    Doesn't directly consider time variation between samples.
